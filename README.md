## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Create a visualization dashboard website plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

Create individual pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. Pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Landing page to see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Requirements

See the ["Screenshots" section](#screenshots) below.

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The website navigation menu:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries). ["Navigation Menu" section](#navigation-menu) (notice the background color change).
